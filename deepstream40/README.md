# Deepstream 4.0 
Installation, articles, tutorials

## Installation

1. Donwnload latests Deepstream 4.X version from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/deepstream-on-jetson-downloads-archived) (make sure that Jetpack version is correct //Use **jtop**)
2. Unzip archive on device
3. Follow the [guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/4.0/dev-guide/index.html)

## Sample applications

Samples description can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/4.0/dev-guide/index.html#page/DeepStream_Development_Guide%2Fdeepstream_quick_start.html%23wwpID0E0GB0HA)

Samples are run from console like:

```sh
./deepstream-test1-app ../../../samples/streams/sample_720p.h264
```

Basically each sample among 'test-' apps is built one upon another:<br>
1. deepstream-test1 is a an app with single network - Object Detector, it's taking video file as input and returns video with annotation
2. deepstream-test2 has two Networks and a Tracker - Object Detector (from test1), Tracker and Object Classifier, input and ouptut are the same as test1
3. deepstream-test3 - takes RTSP stream as input
4. deepstream-app - is a universal reference application, which takes config file as an input and can recieve any type of input/output with any network running as primary/secondary detector
5. objectDetector_Yolo - Deepstream implementation of Yolo detector. Can take pretrained yolo weights, configs and labels as input
