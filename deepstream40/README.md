# Deepstream 4.0 
Installation, articles, tutorials

## Installation

1. Download latests Deepstream 4.X version from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/deepstream-on-jetson-downloads-archived) (make sure that Jetpack version is correct //Use **jtop**)
2. Unzip archive on device
3. Follow the [guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/4.0/dev-guide/index.html)

## Sample applications

Samples description can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/4.0/dev-guide/index.html#page/DeepStream_Development_Guide%2Fdeepstream_quick_start.html%23wwpID0E0GB0HA)

Samples are run from console like:

```sh
deepstream-app -c <path_to_config_file>
```

Basically each sample among 'test-' apps is built one upon another:<br>
1. deepstream-test1 is a an app with single network - Object Detector, it's taking video file as input and returns video with annotation
2. deepstream-test2 has two Networks and a Tracker - Object Detector (from test1), Tracker and Object Classifier, input and ouptut are the same as test1
3. deepstream-test3 - takes RTSP stream as input
4. deepstream-app - is a universal reference application, which takes config file as an input and can recieve any type of input/output with any network running as primary/secondary detector
5. objectDetector_Yolo - Deepstream implementation of Yolo detector. Can take pretrained yolo weights, configs and labels as input

### Back-to-Back detector (Deepstream 5.0 installation)

Reference sources:
1. [Github project](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_reference_apps/tree/master/back-to-back-detectors)
2. [Nvidia Forum QnA](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/back-to-back-detector-with-deepstream-5-0/123381)

Instruction:
1. Go to '/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.0/sources/apps/sample_apps'
2. Create 'deepstream-back-to-back' and 'deepstream-redaction' folders
3. Download [Github project back-to-back](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_reference_apps) and save in 'deepstream-back-to-back'
3. Download [Github project redaction](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/redaction_with_deepstream) and save in 'deepstream-redaction'
4. Unzip 'deepstream_reference_apps-master.zip' -> 'back-to-back-detectors' folder contents into 'deepstream-back-to-back' folder
5. Unzip 'redaction_with_deepstream-master.zip' into 'deepstream-readction'
6. Go to '/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.0/samples/models', create 'Secondary_FaceDetect' folder and move '/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.0/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-redaction/fd_lpd_model' contents in there.
7. Return to '/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.0/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-back-to-back'
8. According to [this](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/back-to-back-detector-with-deepstream-5-0/123381/3) make changes in Makefile and back_to_back_detectors.c; Make sure that relative pathes in primary_detector_config.txt and secondary_detector_config.txt are valid.
9. Build the solution

```sh
cd /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.0/sources/apps/sample_apps/deepstream-back-to-back
export DS_SDK_ROOT="/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.0"
make clean
make
```

10. Run the applicaiton

```sh
./back-to-back-detectors /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-5.0/samples/streams/sample_720p.h264
```
